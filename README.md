# Ships
Shiny app to identify/present ship movements.

Was supposed (by decree of the company with whom I was interviewing) to write the app using a modular approach, shiny-semantic and leaflet.  Was only vaguely familiar with shiny modules and had never used either shiny-semantic or leaflet.  I ended up writing something with a non-modular approach and without semantic but using leaflet (and a few other packages novel to me) which was ineluctible for the particular app.  Then couldn't get it pushed to shinyapps.io because, somehow, various packages I needed aren't available there.  Pisser.
